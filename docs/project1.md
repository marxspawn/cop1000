# Project: Your First Web Site

In this project, you'll create a web site. The content can be pretty much anything as long as you meet the grading criteria. Some ideas are: personal portfolio, fan site for your favorite video game or musician, blog, community group site.

### Grading Criteria

This criteria is required for a grade of :100:.

- [ ] Bootstrap is used.

- [ ] Web site contains text.
- [ ] Web site contains external links.
- [ ] All of the web site's content can be accessed just by scrolling.
- [ ] Users can navigate to different sections of the webpage by clicking buttons in the navigation.
- [ ] The web site contains original content.
- [ ] The web site doesn't contain inappropriate content, as described in the [Student Code of Conduct](http://catalog.valenciacollege.edu/academicpoliciesprocedures/studentcodeofconduct/).

### How to Turn In

1. [Create a new personal repository](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/#create-a-new-repository-on-github) to store your web page, and title it `YOUR-USERNAME.github.io`.
1. Upload the web site files of your project into the `master` branch of your new repository. GitHub will automatically build the site from the `master` branch and serve your web page at `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io`.
1. Create a [new issue in the class repository](https://github.com/cop1000/cop1000/issues/new?title=YOUR-USERNAME's Project 1 submission&labels=project-1&body=Paste your web site's published URL here: %0A%0ACheck each of the following boxes to ensure you can score :100:%0A%0A- [ ] Bootstrap is used.%0A- [ ] Web site contains images.%0A- [ ] Web site contains text.%0A- [ ] Web site contains external links.%0A- [ ] All of the web site's content can be accessed just by scrolling.%0A- [ ] Users can navigate to different sections of the webpage by clicking buttons in the navigation.%0A- [ ] The web site contains original content.%0A- [ ] The web site doesn't contain inappropriate content.%0A- [ ] The web site is published to GitHub Pages.%0A- [ ] The link to the web site is submitted in the class repository.)

### Resources

- Read about [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), pay close attention to [the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=2MsN8gpT6jY) linked on the homepage and the part about [how it works](https://youtu.be/2MsN8gpT6jY?t=58s).
- FreeCodeCamp's [tribute page](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-tribute-page) and [personal portfolio](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-personal-portfolio-webpage) projects are similar in nature and can be used to practice and to gain help, but **they are not exactly the same as this project**.
- Although you can build your web site completely from scratch, you're also invited to use a Bootstrap template, such as those from [Start Bootstrap](https://startbootstrap.com), [W3Schools](http://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_templates.asp), and [ShapeBootstrap](https://shapebootstrap.net/free-templates). If you *do* use one of these templates, please make sure you attribute credit where credit is due.
- If you don't already have a favorite text editor, give [Atom](https://atom.io) a shot. It's compatible with Mac and Windows, and is completely hackable using web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript which... hey... you're learning about :wink:
