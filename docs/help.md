# How to Ask for Help

There are a number of ways you can ask for help. Here are just a few, in order of preference!

1. Use the read-search-ask strategy when you get stuck:
  - First, read the error message, if one exists.
  - If that didn't help, search Google.
  - Finally, ask another human, like your classmates, professor, or a community resource.
1. An [issue](https://github.com/cop1000/cop1000/issues/new) is the easiest way to reach the professor or classmates. When you start a new issue, it will auto-populate with some helpful tips and instructions. Read these!
1. If you are communicating confidential information (like questions about your grade, your VID number, phone number, etc), do not use issues. Instead, you can send an e-mail. You can email the professor or your classmates using the link that appears on Blackboard.
1. Online communities like [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com) and [Gitter](https://gitter.im/) are fantastic ways to get some help. However, if their help yields to a solution, you should attribute credit to them.
1. Tutoring is available at every campus, although each campus has its own tutors with unique expertise. Not every tutor will be familiar with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or GitHub. However, programming concepts are universal and do transfer from one language to another. For example, if you're trying to learn loops in JavaScript, and the tutor you're working with knows C++, they should still be able to help you understand the concept of loops and help you with the syntax in JavaScript by looking it up. You, too, will get the incredible ability to pick up new programming languages with ease once you learn your first :smile: With that said, here's some tutoring availability for this semester:
